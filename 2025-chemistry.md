The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2025 is awarded to Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson, and Omar M. Yaghi for their foundational work in developing Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs), a new type of molecular architecture.

MOFs are highly porous crystalline materials built from metal ions connected by organic molecules. They contain large internal cavities, making them exceptionally useful for various applications.

Key Contributions of the Laureates:
Richard Robson (The Initial Insight): In 1989, Robson published his first innovative chemical creation, inspired by the structure of diamond, using copper ions and a four-armed molecule. He demonstrated that rational design could be used to build spacious crystalline structures, though his early constructions were somewhat unstable.

Susumu Kitagawa (Stability and Flexibility): Starting in the 1990s, Kitagawa pursued the potential of porous molecular structures. In 1997, he achieved a major breakthrough by creating three-dimensional MOFs using cobalt, nickel, or zinc ions that were stable and intersected by open channels, capable of absorbing and releasing gases without changing shape. He later introduced the concept of flexible MOFs that can change shape like a breathing lung when filled or emptied.

Omar M. Yaghi (Coined the Term and Defined Stability/Scale): Yaghi focused on using rational design to connect chemical constituents like LEGO pieces. In 1995, he coined the term "metal–organic framework" (MOF). In 1999, he presented MOF-5, a classic, exceptionally stable, and spacious material where just a few grams contain an internal surface area as big as a football pitch. He further showed the ability to rationally modify MOFs to create entire families of materials with varied properties.

Current and Potential Applications:
The ability to tailor MOFs for specific molecules has led to numerous applications, including:

Water Harvesting: Capturing water vapor from desert air (e.g., MOF-303).

Gas Management: Storing gases like hydrogen (e.g., NU-1501) and methane, or containing toxic gases used in semiconductor production.

Environmental Cleanup: Capturing carbon dioxide from factories (e.g., CALF-20), separating PFAS from water (e.g., UiO-67), and decomposing pollutants like crude oil and antibiotics (e.g., MIL-101).

Other Uses: Trapping ethylene gas to slow fruit ripening, delivering pharmaceuticals, and experimentally mining rare-earth elements.

The laureates’ work has provided chemists with a molecular kit for designing tens of thousands of different MOFs, leading many to believe that these materials hold the potential to be the material of the twenty-first century by offering solutions to major global challenges.
