# Backend Environment Variables

# Firebase Configuration
# ----------------------
# Firebase Admin SDK requires a service account credentials JSON file.
# 
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Go to Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts
# 2. Click "Generate New Private Key" to download the JSON file
# 3. Save the file securely (e.g., backend/firebase-credentials.json)
# 4. Set FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH to the absolute or relative path to this file
# 5. IMPORTANT: Add the credentials file to .gitignore to prevent committing secrets
#
# Example paths:
#   - Relative: ./firebase-credentials.json
#   - Absolute: /path/to/your/firebase-credentials.json
#

FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=./firebase-credentials.json
