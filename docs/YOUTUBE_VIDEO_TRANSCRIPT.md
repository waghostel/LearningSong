# LearningSong: YouTube Video Transcript (3 Minutes)

## Part 1: The Problem & The Solution (0:00 - 0:45)

### Scene: Opening with music and visuals of students struggling to memorize

**Narrator:**
I was always struggle to listen to an educational course or music when I was jogging. It is the time in a day that I can mostly relex and perhaps learning something new.

But, what if you didn't have to choose?

So, I made LearningSong, an AI-powered web app that transforms educational content into memorable songs. Paste that interesting article and let AI generate singable song power by suno. Learn through music with no textbooks required.

Songs stick in your head. So, why not use that for learning and relexing at the same time.

## Part 2: How It Works (0:45 - 1:45)

### Scene: Screen recording of the three-page flow

**Narrator:**
"LearningSong works in three simple steps. If I want to make a song about the research realted to 2025 Nobel Price.

**Page A: Text Input**
We can first paste related content from the the official webside, we can choose toggle Google Search grounding to enrich it with real-world context. and Hit 'Generate Lyrics'.

**Page B: Lyrics Editing**
It will then generates singable lyrics from it. We can review, edit, and refine it. Then choose the music style you prefer from Pop, Rock Jazz Folk .etc.

**Page C: Song Playback**
Just be patientce because the entire flow of music generation takes about 5 minutes. You can pick from two song variations generated by suno.

## Part 3: The Tech Behind It (1:45 - 2:30)

### Scene: Architecture diagram and tech stack visuals

**Narrator:**
"Under the hood, LearningSong is built with chatgpt and suno api. From initial setup to end-to-end testing, I subdivided the implementation into about 10 specs. I try to do both frontend and backend toghther at page basis, since i can test it after a full spec of specific page have been implementd.

## Part 4: Why Spec-Driven Development Matters (2:30 - 3:00)

### Scene: Kiro interface showing specs, design documents, and correctness properties

**Narrator:**
Spec-driven development forces us to think and plan before starting writing the code. Basically we describe our requirements, and let kiro design the code structure and tasks to execute for us.

It can help to reduce ambiguity also catch edge cases before code is written. It make code more testable and verifiable.

I think Spec-driven development may not be faster than vibe-coding but it can build more robust, well-designed application. It is important especially for building complex software.

Another thing I like about kiro is it provide me some gap time during spec implementation. So that I can shift my attentions to other daily routines.

Have fun to transform learning material into music. And if you're building software, consider to try the spec-driven development of Kiro.

I was wondering if  there is a day you can hear lot of interesting abstract songs when you walk in conferecne room in a scientific symposium.  

Thank you for watching.

## Talking Points for Customization

### If you want to emphasize the learning angle:
- "Songs are 10x more memorable than text. Neuroscience proves it."
- "The 2025 Nobel Prize is about immune tolerance. Most people won't remember that. But they'll remember the song."

### If you want to emphasize the tech:
- "Property-based testing with Hypothesis and fast-check ensures correctness across thousands of edge cases."
- "The karaoke sync uses binary search for O(log n) timestamp lookup—efficient even with thousands of lyrics."

### If you want to emphasize Kiro:
- "Kiro implemented 10 complete specs. 50+ tasks per spec. Hundreds of tests. All from conversational design documents."
- "Steering docs kept Kiro aligned with our architecture. Agent hooks automated testing workflows. MCP servers extended Kiro's capabilities."

### If you want to emphasize the user experience:
- "Dual song selection lets you compare AI-generated variations and pick your favorite."
- "Offset adjustment ensures perfect sync between lyrics and music—no more frustration."
