## Project Requirements

### What to Create:

Entrants must build a working software application that uses Kiro (vibe coding, agent hooks, steering docs, MCP, or specs) and submit it into one of the following categories:

### Categories:

1. **Resurrection:** Bring your favorite dead technology back to life. Reimagine obsolete tech with today's innovations or solving tomorrow's problems.

2. **Frankenstein:** Stitch together a chimera of technologies into one app. Bring together seemingly incompatible elements to build something unexpectedly powerful.

3. **Skeleton Crew:** Build a skeleton code template lean enough to be clear but flexible enough to support various use cases. Show us its versatility with two distinct applications from your foundation.

4. **Costume Contest:** Build any app but show us a haunting user interface that's polished and unforgettable. Bring in spooky design elements that enhance your app's function.

### Technical Requirements:

- **Functionality:** The Project must be capable of being successfully installed and running consistently on the platform for which it is intended and must function as depicted in the video and/or expressed in the text description.

- **Platforms:** A submitted Project must run on the platform for which it is intended and which is specified in the Submission Requirements.

- **New & Existing:** Projects must be either newly created by the Entrant or, if the Entrant's Project existed prior to the Hackathon Submission Period, must have been significantly updated and must solve for a new use case after the start of the Hackathon Submission Period. Entrants should explain how their Project was significantly updated and what new use case it solves for during the Submission Period.

- **Third Party Integrations:** If a Project integrates any third-party SDK, APIs and/or data, Entrant must be authorized to use them in accordance with any terms and conditions or licensing requirements of the tool.

## Submission Requirements

Submissions to the Hackathon must meet the following requirements:

Include a Project built with the required developer tools and meets the above Project Requirements.

### 2. Text Description
Include a text description that should explain the features and functionality of your Project.

### 3. Demonstration Video
Include a demonstration video of your Project. The video portion of the Submission:
- Should be less than three (3) minutes. Judges are not required to watch beyond three minutes
- Should include footage that shows the Project functioning on the device for which it was built
- Must be uploaded to and made publicly visible on YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook Video, or Youku, and a link to the video must be provided on the submission form on the Hackathon Website

### 4. Open Source Code Repository
Provide a URL to your open source code repository for judging and testing.

**Repository Requirements:**
- The repository must contain all necessary source code, assets, and instructions required for the project to be functional
- The repository must be public and open source by including an open source license file
- This license should be detectable and visible at the top of the repository page (in the About section)
- The code repository must be public with an approved [OSI Open Source License](https://opensource.org/licenses)
- Your repo must contain the `/.kiro` directory at the root of the project to show usage of specs, hooks, and steering
- **Do NOT add the `/.kiro` directory or sub-folders to your `.gitignore`, as this could disqualify your submission**
- **For Skeleton Crew projects only:** Your repo must contain 2 separate repo folders for the 2 separate applications

### 5. Category Selection
Identify which category and bonus category you are submitting into.

### 6. Kiro Usage Write-up
Provide a write up on how Kiro was used. Judges must understand how effectively you used Kiro to develop your project. Show us your next-level understanding of Kiro features, e.g.:

- **Vibe coding:** How did you structure your conversations with Kiro to build your project? What was the most impressive code generation Kiro helped you with?
- **Agent hooks:** What specific workflows did you automate with Kiro hooks? How did these hooks improve your development process?
- **Spec-driven development:** How did you structure your spec for Kiro to implement? How did the spec-driven approach improve your development process? How did this compare to vibe coding?
- **Steering docs:** How did you leverage steering to improve Kiro's responses? Was there a particular strategy that made the biggest difference?
- **MCP:** How did extending Kiro's capabilities help you build your project? What sort of features or workflow improvements did MCP enable that otherwise would have been difficult or impossible?
