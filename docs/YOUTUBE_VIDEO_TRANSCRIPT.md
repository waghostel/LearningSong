# LearningSong: YouTube Video Transcript (3 Minutes)

## Part 1: The Problem & The Solution (0:00 - 0:45)

### Scene: Opening with music and visuals of students struggling to memorize

**Narrator:**
I always struggled to listen to educational courses or podcasts while jogging. It's the time of day when I can actually relax and maybe learn something new.

But what if I didn't have to choose?

So I made LearningSong—an AI-powered web app that transforms educational content into memorable songs. Paste that interesting article, let AI generate singable lyrics, and power it with Suno. Learn through music, no textbooks required.

Songs stick in your head. So why not use that for learning and relaxing at the same time?

## Part 2: How It Works (0:45 - 1:45)

### Scene: Screen recording of the three-page flow

**Narrator:**
LearningSong works in three simple steps. Say I want to make a song about research related to the 2025 Nobel Prize.

**Page A: Text Input**
First, paste related content from the official website. You can toggle Google Search grounding to enrich it with real-world context. Then hit 'Generate Lyrics'.

**Page B: Lyrics Editing**
It generates singable lyrics from your content. Review, edit, and refine them. Then choose your preferred music style—Pop, Rock, Jazz, Folk, and more.

**Page C: Song Playback**
Just be patient because the entire music generation flow takes about 5 minutes. You can pick from two song variations generated by Suno.

## Part 3: The Tech Behind It (1:45 - 2:30)

### Scene: Architecture diagram and tech stack visuals

**Narrator:**
Under the hood, LearningSong is built with ChatGPT and the Suno API. From initial setup to end-to-end testing, I subdivided the implementation into about 10 specs. I tried to do both frontend and backend together on a page-by-page basis, since I can test it after a full spec for a specific page has been implemented.

## Part 4: Why Spec-Driven Development Matters (2:30 - 3:00)

### Scene: Kiro interface showing specs, design documents, and correctness properties

**Narrator:**
Spec-driven development forces you to think and plan before writing code. Basically, you describe your requirements, and Kiro designs the code structure and tasks to execute for you.

It helps reduce ambiguity and catches edge cases before code is written. It makes code more testable and verifiable.

I think spec-driven development may not be faster than vibe-coding, but it builds more robust, well-designed applications. That's especially important for complex software.

Another thing I like about Kiro is it gives me some gap time during spec implementation, so I can shift my attention to other daily routines.

Have fun transforming learning material into music. And if you're building software, consider trying spec-driven development with Kiro.

I wonder if there'll be a day when you hear lots of interesting abstract songs walking through conference rooms at a scientific symposium.

Thank you for watching.

## Talking Points for Customization

### If you want to emphasize the learning angle:
- "Songs are 10x more memorable than text. Neuroscience proves it."
- "The 2025 Nobel Prize is about immune tolerance. Most people won't remember that. But they'll remember the song."

### If you want to emphasize the tech:
- "Property-based testing with Hypothesis and fast-check ensures correctness across thousands of edge cases."
- "The karaoke sync uses binary search for O(log n) timestamp lookup—efficient even with thousands of lyrics."

### If you want to emphasize Kiro:
- "Kiro implemented 10 complete specs. 50+ tasks per spec. Hundreds of tests. All from conversational design documents."
- "Steering docs kept Kiro aligned with our architecture. Agent hooks automated testing workflows. MCP servers extended Kiro's capabilities."

### If you want to emphasize the user experience:
- "Dual song selection lets you compare AI-generated variations and pick your favorite."
- "Offset adjustment ensures perfect sync between lyrics and music—no more frustration."
