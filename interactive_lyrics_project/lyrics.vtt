00:00:19.867 --> 00:00:20.235
[Verse 1]

2
00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:24.606
In the world of science, a prize was won,

3
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.419
By Brunkow, Ramsdell, and Sakaguchi's fun,

4
00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:34.058
They found a way to keep our bodies safe,

5
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:39.122
From the immune system going on a rampage.

6
00:00:39.176 --> 00:00:44.441
With T cells in action, they defend our health,

7
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:48.271
Helper and Killer, they're the immune wealth,

8
00:00:48.324 --> 00:00:53.489
But don't forget the Regulators in the fight,

9
00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:58.042
Keeping balance in our system, making everything right.

10
00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:58.872
[Chorus]

11
00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:03.894
Oh, immune tolerance, we're learning so much,

12
00:01:03.941 --> 00:01:08.571
Protecting our bodies with a gentle touch,

13
00:01:08.663 --> 00:01:13.302
From autoimmune storms, we find a way,

14
00:01:13.347 --> 00:01:22.859
With T cells guiding us, we're here to stay!

15
00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:23.282
[Verse 2]

16
00:01:23.314 --> 00:01:27.800
Regulatory T cells, the guards in our team,

17
00:01:27.812 --> 00:01:33.295
With CD4 and CD25, they fulfill a dream,

18
00:01:33.383 --> 00:01:37.699
Keeping watch, they won't let us fall,

19
00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:42.495
Preventing our bodies from attacking at all.

20
00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:47.174
In scurfy mice, a mystery was found,

21
00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:52.238
A mutation in genes that turned life around,

22
00:01:52.283 --> 00:01:55.947
With FOXP3, they showed us the key,

23
00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.371
Unlocking the secrets of immune harmony.

24
00:02:01.422 --> 00:02:02.131
[Chorus]

25
00:02:02.223 --> 00:02:07.245
Oh, immune tolerance, we're learning so much,

26
00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:11.922
Protecting our bodies with a gentle touch,

27
00:02:12.014 --> 00:02:16.653
From autoimmune storms, we find a way,

28
00:02:16.698 --> 00:02:36.209
With T cells guiding us, we're here to stay!

29
00:02:36.238 --> 00:02:36.492
[Bridge]

30
00:02:36.514 --> 00:02:41.489
Now researchers are dreaming, with new pathways in sight,

31
00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.989
Treating diseases, making everything right,

32
00:02:46.053 --> 00:02:50.525
By boosting those T cells, we're taking a stand,

33
00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:57.247
Using our own defenses, to heal this land.

34
00:02:57.271 --> 00:02:58.142
[Final Chorus]

35
00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:03.335
Oh, immune tolerance, we're learning so much,

36
00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:07.956
Protecting our bodies with a gentle touch,

37
00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:12.743
From autoimmune storms, we find a way,

38
00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:19.707
With T cells guiding us, we're here to stay!

39
00:03:19.761 --> 00:03:23.138
Yes, with T cells guiding us, we're here to stay!
